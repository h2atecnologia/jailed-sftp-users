(Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 server)

This repo contains scripts to manage jailed SFTP users with
username and password authentification (via SSH).

DISCLAIMER:

Please make sure you've tested these scripts before using them, 
and that the configuration setup suits your needs (in terms of 
usage and security).

I also recommended using these scripts on a dedicated server 
(such as an AWS EC2 instance).

USAGE: 

You will need to run the `initialize` script that will make
sure the server is configured correctly to create and allow
the jailed users to connect from a `sftpusers` group.

./initialize

Use `create_user` to create new jailed users on the server.

./create_user <username> <password>

This will give them access to their own jailed directory
at /home/<username>/data

Use `delete_user` to delete users from the server.

./delete_user <username>
